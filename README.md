# Argentina Copa América 2024 Performance Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focusing on Argentina's performance in the Copa América 2024. The analysis provides insights into match statistics and shotmaps, examining how the team’s playing style and effectiveness evolved from the group phase to the knockout stage. 

## Project Overview

This project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing to assess the team’s metrics, such as ball possession, passing accuracy, shot positioning, and expected goals (xG) across two stages of the tournament. The aim is to determine key factors that influenced the team's performance and suggest areas for further analysis.

## Files and Structure

- **`eda_report.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and hypothesis testing.
- **Data Files**: CSV files with match statistics, including data on shotmaps, goals, passes, and other performance metrics.
## Key Findings

### Shotmap Analysis
- Players primarily took shots from central positions close to the goal and within the penalty box.
- Outliers were not significantly distant from the main cluster of shots.
- Higher expected goals (xG) values were associated with shots taken from these central positions, as indicated by larger circles on the shotmap scatterplot.

### Performance Metrics
- **Ball Possession**: Hypothesis testing revealed a significant decrease in ball possession from the group phase to the knockout stage.
- **Passing Accuracy**: The decline in possession was accompanied by a reduction in passing accuracy, which likely contributed to the lower possession rate in the knockout stage.

## Next Steps

This analysis lays the foundation for future exploration, with potential areas of focus including:
- **Expected Goal Effectiveness**: Examining how efficiently Argentina converted expected goals into actual goals.
- **Optimal Shot Locations**: Identifying the best locations on the field for scoring based on past performance.
- **Defensive Metrics**: Analyzing defensive stats like tackles, interceptions, and blocks to understand Argentina's defensive strengths and weaknesses.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing Argentina’s performance with other top teams in the tournament to identify competitive advantages or areas for improvement.
